-- JomDekan — development seed data
-- =====================================================================
-- Safe to run repeatedly against a local/dev database (ON CONFLICT DO
-- NOTHING). Never run against production. Contains no real credentials
-- or personal data — university/subject examples only, and they do not
-- imply institutional endorsement.
--
-- Usage:
--   psql -U postgres -d jomdekan -f database/seed.sql
--
-- To create the FIRST ADMIN account, do not seed a password hash here.
-- Register a normal account through the API, then promote it with:
--   npm --prefix backend run create-admin -- --email you@example.com
-- (see backend/src/utils/createAdmin.ts and docs/setup.md)

-- Universities are fully seeded by migration 009 (the real Malaysian
-- university list) — do not insert them here too. Doing so previously
-- created duplicate rows (same name, different slug) that the slug
-- UNIQUE constraint couldn't catch; see migration 011.
